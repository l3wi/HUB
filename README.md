## Introduction

### Overview

IOTA Hub is a multi-user-wallet used by those with custody of other’s tokens and those requiring the secure management of IOTA tokens.  Companies use Hub to manage the complicated tasks associated with deposits and withdrawals of Iota. 

Hub was developed with the security in mind and includes a number of options to protect tokens in the Hub.  It was decoupled from other IOTA products because Hub is a unique application that runs on top of our decentralized ledger, called the Tangle

### Use Case
IOTA’s desire for easy trading of iota tokens prompted Hub development.  Hub is primarily for currency exchanges, but others may use Hub to automate account management
